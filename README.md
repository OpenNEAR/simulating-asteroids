# Simulating Asteroids: Detection & Analysis

With the increasing performance of telescopes and budget limitations, asteroid research faces many challenges. Currently, there are too many data-acquisition technologies such as telescopes and radio-telescopes, but not enough data-analysis technologies such as orbit simulators and probability of collision models. A highly efficient analysis system that is both time and cost effective would be beneficial to furthering asteroid research. The algorithm developed focuses on the development of an alternative analysis system which implements the K-Nearest Neighbour method which, in turn, facilitates our ability to analyze and simulate the information collected by telescopes. This offers a means of meeting both the time and economic goals of the space industry.
